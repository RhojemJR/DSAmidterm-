# React JS  

## What is React JS? 
An open-source JavaScript library called **React JS**, or simply **React**, is used to create user interfaces (UI), mostly for single-page applications (SPAs). Facebook created it and maintains it in collaboration with a developer community. With React, developers can create reusable user interface (UI) components that can be combined to create intricate user interfaces and maintain their own state.

React uses a concept called the virtual DOM to render and refresh the user interface (UI) more efficiently. React may reduce direct manipulation of the real DOM and enhance performance by using the virtual DOM, which is a lightweight replica of the real DOM in memory.

### Key Features: 
1. **Component-Based Architecture:** 
- React encourages the creation of reusable components, which facilitates code management and maintenance.
- Each component has its own state and lifecycle functions, and these can be either functional or class-based.
2. **Declarative Syntax:** 
- React lets developers specify how the user interface (UI) should appear in a specific state, and it will take care of updates automatically as the state changes.
3. **Virtual DOM:**
- React enhances performance by using a virtual DOM. React updates the virtual DOM and compares it with the real DOM whenever a component's state changes. Only the modified portions of the user interface are updated thanks to this procedure, which is known as reconciliation.
4. **Unidirectional Data Flow:**
- Through props, data moves from parent components to child components in a single path. This facilitates the management of application state and the tracking of changes.
5. **JSX (JavaScript XML):**
- React enhances performance by using a virtual DOM. React updates the virtual DOM and compares it with the real DOM whenever a component's state changes. Only the modified portions of the user interface are updated thanks to this procedure, which is known as reconciliation.
6. **Hooks:**
- In version 16.8, React included hooks (such as useState, useEffect, and useContext) that let developers use lifecycle and state functions in functional components, improving their ability to handle state without relying on class-based components.
7. **React Developer Tools:**
- To assist developers in inspecting and debugging React components and their state, React offers browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox.

## How to Set Up React JS?

### Prerequiste Apps
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you begin setting up React, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js:** React requires Node.js to run. It’s a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. You can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
  - React and its dependencies are among the packages that may be managed with npm (Node Package Manager), which is included with Node.js.
- **Code Editor:** Although any text editor can be used, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) is strongly advised due to its React-specific add-ons, including code formatting, debugging tools, and auto-completion.
###  Setting Up a React Application
**Install Node.js and npm**
React requires Node.js, which comes with npm (Node Package Manager), a tool used to install libraries and dependencies.
1. **Download Node.js:** 
    - Visit the official Node.js website: [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
    - Download and install the LTS version (recommended for most users).

    
2. **Verify Installation:** 
    - After installing, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and check if Node.js and npm were installed correctly: 
```js 
node -v
npm -v
```
> [!NOTE]
> This should print the versions of Node.js and npm installed on your system.

3. **Create a New React App:**  <br />
Now, let’s use Create React App to quickly set up your project.
- Open your terminal and run:
```js
npx create-react-app my-app
```
> [!NOTE]
>This creates a new folder named my-app with all the necessary files.
- Navigate to the project folder:
```js
cd my-app
```

4. **Start the Development Server:** <br />

In the terminal, run:
```js
npm start
```

5. **Edit Your First React Component:**  <br />

Open the project folder in a code editor (like Visual Studio Code).
6. **Done!** <br />

Now you have a basic React app running! You can start building and adding more components as you get comfortable.
